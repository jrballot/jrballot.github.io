As part of my job as a Consultant I need to get some specific certifications from time to time. And recently I got invited to take the beta exame 305 which is a split from the old **304 - Enterprise Virtualization and High Availability**, creating the **305 - Enterprise Virtualization and Containerization** and **306 - Enterprise High Availability and Cluster Storage**.

<!--more-->

Following are the objectives for this certification (305):

**[305 - Enterprise Virtualization and Containerization](https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/LPIC-305_Objectives_V3.0)**
- 4.1 Topic 351: Full Virtualization
  - 4.1.1 351.1 Virtualization Concepts and Theory (weight: 6)
  - 4.1.2 351.2 Xen (weight: 3)
  - 4.1.3 351.3 QEMU (weight: 4)
  - 4.1.4 351.4 Libvirt Virtual Machine Management (weight: 9)
  - 4.1.5 351.5 Virtual Machine Disk Image Management (weight: 3)
- 4.2 Topic 352: Container Virtualization
  - 4.2.1 352.1 Container Virtualization Concepts (weight: 7)
  - 4.2.2 352.2 LXC (weight: 6)
  - 4.2.3 352.3 Docker (weight: 9)
  - 4.2.4 352.4 Container Orchestration Platforms (weight: 3)
- 4.3 Topic 353: VM Deployment and Provisioning
  - 4.3.1 353.1 Cloud Management Tools (weight: 2)
  - 4.3.2 353.2 Packer (weight: 2)
  - 4.3.3 353.3 cloud-init (weight: 3)
  - 4.3.4 353.4 Vagrant (weight: 3)
 
So basically we have 3 main topics: Virtualization, Containers and Deploy and Provision. The latest is a bit of a mix between lab tools like Vagrant and cloud tools like Packer for image creation, cloud-init for customization and some awareness of Cloud Management Tools like OpenStack and Terraform.

The first two topics are focused in Virtualization with classic solutions like QEMU, KVM and Libvirt and Containers with the focus on Docker, LXC and some Container Conpects.

What we can reason from this list is that this certification is for a professional that is working on on-premises virtualization and cloud solutions but is also aware of containers solutions.

In order to study for this certification I will write a post for every item in this list describing step by step what I am using, which labs I'm creating in order to practice and get prepared.

Looking forward for this.

Thanks :)
